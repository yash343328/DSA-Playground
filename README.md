# DSA Playground – by Yash Jain

🚀 **Interactive Data Structures & Algorithms Visualizer**  

**DSA Playground** is a **frontend-only project** to **practice and visualize Data Structures & Algorithms** with interactive simulations.  
Perfect for **students, developers, and coding enthusiasts** who want to understand DSA concepts visually.

## 🌟 Features

- **Array Operations** – Insert, delete, traverse, and understand array fundamentals.  
- **Stack** – LIFO simulation with push and pop operations.  
- **Queue** – FIFO simulation with enqueue and dequeue.  
- **Linked List** – Node-based creation and traversal.  
- **Linear Search** – Step-by-step search in an unsorted list.  
- **Binary Search** – Efficient search on sorted data visually.  
- **Bubble Sort** – Animated comparison and swapping of array elements.  
- **Merge Sort** – Recursive divide and merge sorting visualization.  
- **Tree Traversal (Inorder)** – Binary tree traversal visualization.  
- **Graph Traversal (BFS)** – Breadth-first search simulation with queue logic.
